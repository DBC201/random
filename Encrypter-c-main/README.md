# Encrypter
Encrypts and decrypts inputs from the text file. Don't forget to delete additional information and just leave the input(while decrypting). Supported characters can be edited with ease by adding or removing them from char alphabet[]. \

Deep Encryption: Now you can encrypt the encrypted string. Be careful of spaces etc, there shouldnt be anything unnecessary in the text file. Also while decrytping a deep encrypted string, use the c mode by typing c in the console. There is a bug in this though, c mode leaves spaces at the end, don't forget to delete them. I will fix this when I get to view this code again. 

IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE '~' CHARACTER IN CHAR ALPHABET. THIS CHARACTER IS USED FOR '\n' WHILE PRINTING THE ENCRYPTED OUTPUT. CHANGE THIS TO SOMETHING ELSE FIRST, THEN ADD IT TO CHAR ALPHABET.

Note: In order for the program to work correctly, both parties should have the exact the same char alphabet array in exact the same order.
